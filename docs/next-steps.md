# 🚀 Next Steps for LocAIte Project

This document outlines the key development milestones and technical directions for the LocAIte platform as we move to the next phase of implementation.

---

## ✅ Current Status

- [x] GitHub repository initialized
- [x] Frontend scaffolded using React + TypeScript + Material UI
- [x] Flask AI API set up for facial recognition
- [x] ICP canister folder created and bootstrapped
- [x] Documentation folder and basic READMEs set up

---

## 🔧 Upcoming Development Milestones

### 1. 🧠 Smart Contract Logic (ICP Backend)

Implement the ICP canister backend logic using **Motoko** or **Rust** to handle:

- ➕ Adding a missing person record
- 🧾 Storing metadata (IPFS hash, timestamp, name, region)
- 🔍 Querying for potential matches
- 📜 Logging and returning detection events

> ⬜ Motoko for smart contract language.

---

### 2. �� Integrate Flask AI API with React Frontend

Connect the Flask-based facial recognition API to the React app:

- 📤 Add a form to upload image + metadata
- 🔁 Send requests from frontend to backend
- 📬 Display detection results:  
  - Possible Match  
  - No Match  
  - Metadata or timestamp info

---

### 3. 🚀 Deploy Canisters to Local or Mainnet

- ⚙️ Configure `dfx.json` with correct actor, interface, and identity
- 🧪 Use `dfx start` and `dfx deploy` for local testing
- 🌐 Optionally deploy to the Internet Computer mainnet

---

### 4. ��️ Build Full Frontend Experience

- UI for adding missing person records
- Form for uploading photo + name + region
- Results panel with facial match info and blockchain metadata
- Material UI components and modern layout

---

### 📊 Optional Add-Ons

- ✅ Toast notifications and loading spinners
- ✅ IPFS upload integration (via Pinata or NFT.storage)
- ✅ Admin dashboard for statistics (queries, successful matches)
- ✅ Date-based filters for logged match events
- ✅ Multi-language or regional support

---

## 📌 Notes

- All progress and features should be reflected in the `/docs` folder.
- Major logic changes must be documented in `architecture.md` or `readme.md` files per folder.
- Consider privacy and data ethics in all data handling flows.
